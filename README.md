PerfectXL-Rubberduck
====================

PerfectXL VbaCodeAnalyzer uses code of Rubberduck. [Rubberduck](http://rubberduckvba.com/) is an open-source project that parses and inspects [VBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications) code. It is licensed under the GPLv3 license and the source code is available at [https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck).

Similarly, PerfectXL VbaCodeAnalyzer is open source, with its source code publicly available at [https://github.com/PerfectXL/PerfectXL-Rubberduck](https://github.com/PerfectXL/PerfectXL-Rubberduck).

Our modifications to the original software are available in a forked repository at [https://github.com/PerfectXL/Rubberduck](https://github.com/PerfectXL/Rubberduck). The main change is that we eliminated EasyHook because we don't require any COM calls.

The analyzer can be installed as a Windows service. It provides an HTTP API where you can submit VBA code and retrieve inspection results.
