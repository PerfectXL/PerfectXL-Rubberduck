## Rubberduck.CodeAnalysis.Inspections.Concrete

All concrete code inspection implementations (classes) must be in their own .cs source file **in a namespace that corresponds to its folder location**, under this namespace.

The xml-doc content in this namespace is automatically downloaded, processed, and ultimately served on the rubberduckvba.com website feature pages.

Each inspection can have as many examples using as many modules of as many types as necessary. The following string values are recognized as module types:

- "Standard Module"
- "Class Module"
- "Predeclared Class"
- "Interface Module"
- "UserForm Module"
- "Document Module"

The "edit this page" link on each page generated from xml-doc content in this namespace, links to `https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/edit/next/{namespace}/{inspection-name}.cs`; it is imperative that the files' folder location corresponds to their namespace, lest we generate broken links on the website.

The content generated from xml-doc in this namespace (and any concrete inspections in a namespace under it) is accessible at `https://rubberduckvba.com/inspections/details/{inspection-name}`.
